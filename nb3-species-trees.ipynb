    "## Species tree (population structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multispecies Coalescent (MSC) is a model that describes genealogical relationships among 2 or more populations (or species). You can think of this model as a \"stitching together\" of coalescent models for multiple distinct populations. This is sometimes also called a \"species tree\". A species tree is defined by a topology (branching order) with edge lengths (in units of generations), and effective population sizes assigned to each edge. This effectively defines a container in which genealogies are embedded. Remember, this is the topic we introduced at the beginning of notebook 1, that genealogies are embedded within species trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we view the coalescent process as occurring backwards in time, from the tips towards the root of the species tree, we can follow the coalescence of samples within each interval (branch) of the species tree. Starting from the tips of the species tree, gene copies can coalesce within the species tree edge in which they originate, or not. If they do not coalesce by the time they reach the top of that species tree interval, they enter the next ancestral interval (an internal species tree edge) at which point they can potentially coalesce with gene copies from the other species tree branch that was also descended this interval. For example, gene copies that do not coalesce within species tree edge 0 below, will enter species tree edge 3, at which point they might coalesce with a gene copy from population 1 before coalescing with another sample from population 0. This is an example of a process termed **incomplete lineage sorting**. This is would lead to the genealogy not matching the topology of the species tree.\n",

In the scenario below, we will set a fixed `Ne` value for all edges of the species tree, here setting it to a very small value. The coalescences happen very quickly within each population because the `Ne` value is so low relative to the species tree edge lengths. \n",

When this occurs it can lead to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). \n",

For example, in the first genealogy below, sample \"r0_2\" groups with the samples in population \"r1\" instead of with the other samples in population \"r0\". This is inly possible because sample \"r0_2\" persisted farther back in time than the speciation event at time=50,000 before coalescing with another sample.
